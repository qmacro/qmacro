### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [Developer Advocate](https://developers.sap.com/developer-advocates.html) at SAP.

I've been hacking on SAP enterprise software for more than three decades, and am still enjoying it. I've [written books](https://qmacro.org/about/#writing-and-talks) for Oâ€™Reilly and SAP Press, and speak at conferences and meetups around the world. I write posts on various topics on my [blog](https://qmacro.org/blog/), so head on over there to see what might take your fancy. I also write posts on the SAP Community under [my current profile](https://people.sap.com/dj.adams.sap#content:blogposts) and there are also some older posts under [my previous profile](https://people.sap.com/dj.adams#content:blogposts) too.
