I'm a [Developer Advocate](https://developers.sap.com/developer-advocates.html) at SAP.

I've been hacking on SAP enterprise software for a long time, and am still enjoying it. I've [written books](https://qmacro.org/about/#writing-and-talks) for Oâ€™Reilly and SAP Press, and speak at conferences and meetups around the world. Find out more [about me here](https://qmacro.org/about).
